Data compression
	File Compression
		Text files are usually stored by representing each character with an 8-bit ASCII code
		The ASCII encoding is an example of fixed length encoding where each character is represented with the same number of bits
		In order to reduce the space required to store a text file we can exploit the fact that some characters are more likely to occure than others
		Variable-Length Encoding
			Uses binary codes of different lengths for different characters thus we can assign fewer bits to frequently used characters and more bits to rarely used characters
		An encoding example
			text : java
			encoding a=0 j=11 v=10 ( Satisfies the prefix rule)
			encoded text 110100
		How to decode (problems in ambiguity)
			encoding a = 0 j=01 v=00
			encoded text 010000
			could be java or jvv or jaaaa (Does not statisfy the prefix rule a is a prefix of code j and v)
		To prevent ambiguities in decoding we require that encoding statisfies the prefix rule no code is a prefix of another
		We use an encoding trie to satisfy this prefix rule
			The characters are stored at the external node so there is no chance of code word being a prefix od another
			A left child means 0
			A right child means 1
			To determine codeword for each character we trace the path from root to leaf
		Optimal Compression
			An issue with encoding tries is to ensure that the encoded text is as short as possible
		Constructing algorithm
			Given frequencies of characters we wish to compute a trie so that the length of the encoding is minimum possible
			Each character is a leaf of the trie
			The nunber of bits used to encode a character is its level number (root is 0)
			Thus if fi is the frequency of the ith character and li is the level of the leaf corresponding to it then we want to find tree wich minimizes sigma(fili)
			The quantity of sigma(fi,li) is called total external weighted path length of a tree
			We view each leaf as having a weight equal to the frequency of the corresponding character
			Given weights f1,f2,f3 ... we wish to find a tree whose weighted external path length is minimum
