Ratio and proportion
	A ratio is an ordered comparison of quantities of the same units
	One quantity is how much more or how much less than the other quantity is Comparison by Subtraction
	One quantity is how many times more or less than the other is Comparison by Division
	The type of comparison where we compare things by divison is called Ratio
	When we compare two quantities they must be in the same units
	In general the ratio of two quantities a and b is written as a:b and we read as " a is to b " 
	The two quantities a and b are called terms of the ratio . First quantity 'a' is called first term or antecedent and second quantity "b" is called second term or consequent
	A ratio is said to be in the simplest form or in the lowest terms when it is written in terms of whole numbers with no common factors other than 1
	Equivalent ratios are ratios which are equal in their lowest terms
		ie 30:24 = 24:16
	The equality of ratios is Proportion
	The method in which we first find the value of one unit and then the value of required number of units is known as Unitary method
