Measurements of lines and angles
	Lines are measured in length using ruler and divider
	Use divider to prevent angular viewing
	The unit of measuring length is 1 cm = 10mm
Angles
	Zero angle = 0
	Acute angle < 90
	Right angle = 90
	Obtuse angle > 90
	Straight angle = 180
	Complete angle = 360
	Reflex angle 180 < x < 360
	Angles where the ray moves in the opposite direction of the hands of a clock are called Anti clock-wise angles
	Anti clock-wise angles are denoted by a positive measure
	Angles where the ray moves in the direction of the hands of a clock are called clockwise angles
	They are denoted by negative sign
	The unit of measuring an angle is a degree.It is 1/360th part of one revolution
If two lines have a common point then they are intersecting lines
Two lines can have atmost one intersection point
If two lines meet at a point at right angles then they are called as perpendicular lines
If two lines on a place do not intersect at any point in a plane then they are called as parallel lines
Two parallel lines do not have a common point
