Whole numbers
	N = {1,2,3,4,5...}
	Every natural number has a predecessor expect for 1
	When we add zero to natual numbers the set becomes Whole numbers
	Evert whole number can be represented on the number line
	Number which occur on the right side of the number line is greater than number which is on left side
	All natural numbers are whole numbers
	All whole numbers have successor 
	All whole numbers except for zero have predecessor
Addition 
	This corresponds to moving right on the number line
Subtraction
	This corresponds to moving left on the number line
Multiplication 
	This corresponds to making jumps of equal distances from zero
	Repeated addition
Division 
	This corresponds to number of equal steps taken from a number for the given number to reach to zero
	Division by zero is not defined because we wont be able to reach to zero 
	Repeated division
Addition & Multiplication
	When two whole numbers are added we get a whole numbers
	for example 2 + 3
	When two whole numbers are multiplied we again get a whole numbers
	So we can say that whole numbers are closed under addition and multiplication
Subtraction & Division
	Subtraction or division of whole numbers will not result in an whole numbers
	So as a result whole numbers are not closed under subtraction and division
	for example 2-3 or 2/3
Commutativity of whole numbers
	a + b = b + a
	i.e we can add two whole numbers in any order
	a * b = b * a
	i.e we can multiply any two whole numbers in any order
Associative property
	(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
	(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)
Identity
	When we add 0 to any whole numbers we get same old whole number again
		So 0 is the additive identity for whole numbers
	When we multiply 1 to any whole numbers we get back the same old whole number again
		So 1 is multiplicative identity for whole numbers
