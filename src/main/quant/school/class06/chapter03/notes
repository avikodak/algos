Divisibility rule
	We say that the number is completely divisible by another number when it leaves zero as remainder
	The process of checking whether a number is divisible by a given number without the actual division is called divisibility rule of the number
Divisibility by 2
	We say that the number is divisible by 2 if the by number has 0,2,4,6,8 in the units digit
Divisibility by 3
	Number is divisible by 3 if sum of digits is divisible by 3
Divisibility by 4
	Number is divisible by 4 if last two digits is divisible by 4
Divisibility by 5
	Number is divisible by 5 if digit is either 0 or 5
Divisibility by 6
	Number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by 2 or 3
Divisibility by 8	
	Number is divisible by 8 if last three digits is divisible by 8
Divisibility by 9
	Number is divisible by 9 if sum of digits is divisible by 9
Divisibility by 10
	Number is divisible by 10 if units digits in the number is 0
Divisibility by 11
	Number is divisible by 11 if difference of sum of digits at odd place and sum od digits in even place is divisible by 11
	In general a number is divisible by a number if it is divisible by its coprime
Factor
	A number is said to be a factor of other numbers it is divides the other number exactly i.e without leaving remainder
Prime number
	A number is called prime number if it has exactly 2 numbers as its factor
	The smallest of all factors of a given number is 1
	The greatest factor for any given number is a number itself
Composite number
	A number is said to be composite it has more than 2 factors
	
	1 is neither prime or composite because it has only 1 factor
Co-prime/Relatively prime
	We say that two numbers are co-prime if they have 1 as the only common factor
	Co-prime numbers need not be prime numbers for example 4 and 5
Sieve of eratostthenes
	Fastest way of generating the prime numbers
Twin primes
	Twin primes are prime numbers that differ from each other  by two e.g. (3,5) (5,7) (11,13) (17,19)
Prime factorization
	When a number is expressed as a product of its factors , we say that the number has been factorized.The process of finding factors is called factorization
	When all the factors are prime numbers is known as prime factorization
Highest Common Factor / Greatest common divisor (H.C.F / G.C.D)
	HCF of two or more given numbers is the highest of all the common factors.
Least common multiple (L.C.M)
	The lcm of two or more given numbers is the lowest of their common multiples
	If one of the two given numbers is a mupltiple of the other,then the greater number is the LCM of the given numbers
