Introduction to algebra
	A variable takes different values.Its value is not fixed
	We may use any letter a,b,m etc to represent variable
	A variable allows us to express relations in any practical situation
	Variables are numbers although their value is not fixed , We can do operations on them just as in case of fixed numbers
	An equation is a condition on a variables
	Solution of an equation is the value of the variable for which LHS and RHS are equal . The solution is also called as root of an equation
	The LHS of an equation is equal to its RHS only for definite values of the variablesin the equation
	To get the solution of an equation one of the methods is trial and error method
