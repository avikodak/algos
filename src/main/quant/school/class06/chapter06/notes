Integers
	The numbers which are positive,zero and negative numbers together are called Integer and are denoted by letter I
	The numbers which are on the right side of zero are positive numbers and numbers on left side of zero are negative numbers
	Any two distinct numbers that give zero when added to each other are additive inverse of each other
	The sum of any two positive integers is always a positve integer
	The sum of any two negative integers is always a negative integer
	To add a positive integer we move towards right on the number line
	To add a negative integer we move towards left on the number line
	When one positive and one negative integer are added we subtract them and put the sign of the biggest number
	The subtraction of integers is the same as the adddition of their additive inverse
