Basic geometry
	A point is almost invisible tiny dot
	Points are represented by upper case letters
	A point determines a location
Line segment 
	A line segment is formed by joining two points.
	It has fixed length
	It is the smallest distance between any two points 
	AB(bar)
Line
	A line segment in which both ends are extended beyond the end points
	Lines are usually denoted by lower case letters
	We can draw infinite lines through a point in a plane
Ray
	A ray is a part of a line.It begins at a point and goes on endlessly in a specified direction
	Sunrays or torch
Curve 
	Any figure drawn without 
	A line or outline which gradually deviates from being straight for some or all of its length
	Straight line is also a curve in mathematics
Closed curve
	Two endpoints of the curve meet
Simple curve
	A curve which doesnt cross itself
Polygon
	A polygon is a simple closed figure made up of definite number of line segments
	Boundary wall of a park divides the plane into three parts i.e. inside the park,the park boundary and outside the park
	A closed figure separates the plane into 3 parts
		Interior of the figure 
		Boundary of the figure
		Exterior of the figure
	Region = Interior + Boundary
Angle
	When two rays meet at a common end point then an angle is formed
	The two rays forming an angle are called arms or sides of the angle
	The common end point is called vertex of the angle
	Angle divides the plane into 3 parts
		Interior :- bounded by two sides of the angle
		Exterior :- Outside of the two sides of the angle
Triangle
	The simple closed figure formed by three line segments
	The line segments which form triangle are called sides of the triangle
	The end points of the triangle are called vertices of the triangle
	There are three interior angles for a triangles 
	Triangle is a first polygon
	The triangle divides the plane into three regions
		Interior of the triangle
		Boundary of the triangle
		Exterior of the triangle
Quadilateral
	A quadilateral is a simple closed figure formed with four line segments
	Quadilateral has 4 line segments , 4 angles , 2 diameters
	A diameter is a line segments which joins opposite vertices in a quadilateral
	Like triangle quadilateral divides the plane into three regions
		Exterior , Interior , Boundary
Circle
	A circle is a simple shape of Euclidean geometry that is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre
	The point in the midle is the center
	The length of the curve edge is called circumference
	Distance between center to any point on the circle is called radius
	A line segment joining two points in the circumference on the circle is called chord
	A chord passing through the center of the circle is called diameter of the circle
	Diameter is the longest chord
	Length of diameter = 2 * radius of the circle
	The part of the circle is called arc
	The region in the interior of a circle enclosed by the boundary is called circular region
	Region enclosed by an arc and two radii is called sector of the circle
		Minor sector
		Major sector
	Region enclosed by an arc and a chord is called segment of the circle 
		Minor segment
		Major segment
	Region enclosed by an arc and a diameter is a semi circular region
