Perimeter and area
	The length of the boundary of a closed figure is called its perimeter
	Perimeter is the distance covered along the boundary forming a closed figure
	Perimeter of rectangle = 2 * (length + breadth)
Regular polygon 
	Polygons are simple closed figures bounded by line segments
	A polygon is called a regular polygon if all is sides are of equal length and all angles are of equal measure
	Perimeter of square = 4 * length of side
	Perimeter of equilateral triangle = 2 *length of side
Regular shapes
	Geometrical shapes that have all the sides equal and all angles equal are called regular shapes
Area
	The amount of surface enclosed by closed figure is called its area
	Area of rectangle = length * breadth
	Area of square = pow(side,2)
	The area of square is more than the area of rectangle having the same perimeter
