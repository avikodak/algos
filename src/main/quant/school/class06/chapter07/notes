Fractions and Decimals
	A fraction means a part of a group or of a whole
	Denominator represents the number of equal parts into which the whole has been divided
	Numerator represents the number of equal parts which have been taken out or selected
	Proper fractions 
		These are fractions which are less than one
		In proper fractions numerator is less than denominator
	Improper fractions
		These are fractions which are greater than one
		Numerator is greater than denominator
	Mixed fractions
		An improper fraction can be written as a combination of a whole and a part
	Equivalent fractions
		These fractions arise when we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by same number
	Standard form 
		These are the fractions in which numerator and denominator do not have any common factors
	Like fractions
		The fractional numbers that have same denominators
	Unlike fractions
		The fractional numbers in which denominators are not the same
	Before addition , subtraction , comparing fractions we have to convert the given fractions to like fractions
	A fraction is said to be in the standard form if its numerator and the denominator have no common factors except 1
	All decimals can be represented on number line
	Any two decimal numbers can be compared among themselves.The comparison can start with the whole part.If the whole parts
	are equal then the tenth parts can be compared and so on
